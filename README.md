# LibFinder
LibFinder is a prototype that recommend potential third-party libraries for mobile app develoment or enhancement.

We realize it by two different languages. The first one is programmed in Matlab with a GUI, and is proposed in this respository. The second one is programmed in Python and is deployed as a web service, and you can use it through any browsers.
## Difference
* Matlab version has a GUI and you can choose the libraries your app has invoked, then LibFinder will give you new recommendations. So you'd better known your app well before using it.
* Python version can analyse your app automaticly, even you known nothing about your app, then give you some recommendations.

## Usage of Matlab version:
### Needs:
* Matlab
### Stepsï¼š
* Clone and download all files in LibFinder
* Change the root folder of Matlab to the folder of 'Libfinder'
* Type 'guide' in Matlab
* Open 'LibFinder.m'
* Cheers
