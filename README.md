# LibFinder
LibFinder is a prototype that recommend potential third-party libraries for mobile app develoment or enhancement.

We realize it by two different languages. The first one is programmed in Matlab with a GUI, and is proposed in this respository. The second one is programmed in Python and is deployed in AWS, and you can use it through any browsers.
## Difference
* Matlab version has a GUI and you can choose the libraries your app has invoked, then LibFinder will give you new recommendations. So you'd better known your app well before using it.
* Python version can analyse your app automaticly, even you known nothing about your app, then give you some recommendations.
